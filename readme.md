# Code Rocks.

### Overview

Code Rocks is a simple, Blackjack-style game in which the player tries to match their score to a target score without going over. This is done by clicking one of four randomly displayed gems each game -- each gem type worth a different, random value -- until the target score is hit.

This app is deployed on GitHub at https://andrewbayles.github.io/code-rocks/

### A Few Things To Remember:

* Since the same type of gem can appear more than once in each game, each gem **type** is worth a certain value -- not each individual gem.

* The player is never shown the gem values.

* A game is won when the player's score matches the target score.

* A game is lost if the player's score goes above the target.
