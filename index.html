			<h3>Player Instructions</h3>

			<p>Code Rocks is a simple, Blackjack-style game in which the player tries to match their score to a target score without going over. This is done by clicking one of four randomly displayed gems each game -- each gem type worth a different, random value -- until the target score is hit.</p>

			<h4>Rules</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>You will be presented with four gemstones, each of a certain type. The gem types are each worth a different amount each game.</li>
				<li>You will also be presented with a random target score each game. Your goal is to match your score with the target score, without going over!</li>
				<li>Click on each gem and keep track of how much each type is worth to reach the target.</li>
				<li>Every time you hit the target score is a win. Every time you go above the target is a loss.</li>
				<li>See how many wins you can accumulate!</li>
			</ul>
